	<h1 class="h1">About Us</h1>
	<p class="freshtext">USPizza is all about quality you can trust. As one of the original founding Pizza brands <br />and the 3rd largest Pizza chain in India, our sole mission is making the freshest, <br />tastiest and funnest Pizza around.

Our classic pan pizza will always be a fan favourite,<br /> with a soft and chewy crust perfectly balancing out the healthy tomato pure and <br /> mozzarella - cheddar blended cheese.

Our authentic Italian crust for those who would <br />prefer a light and airy crust to more fully enjoy the toppings. Thin, light and delicious.<br />

Our newest addition of Puree sauces will blow your mind. Chose between a spicy <br /> buffalo, sweet bbq, tangy chipotle can creamy makhni to perfectly compliment  <br />yourtoppings and crust. 

Contrary to industry standard strategy, USPizza, since 1996, <br /> has been committed to growing our brand slowly and steadily. Every outlet is carefully <br /> selected on strict criteria. To be a USPizza franchisee is a privilege unto itself.
